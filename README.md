# GDELT Insight Hub Dashboard

## Overview
The GDELT Insight Hub Dashboard is an end-to-end data processing and visualization platform designed to analyze global events on a daily basis using the GDELT dataset. This repository contains the code, Docker files, and configurations necessary to deploy the entire pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offering a powerful tool for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing global events.

## Architecture

The architecture is designed for scalability and flexibility, using the following key components:

- **Dataflow Pipeline:**
  - Ingests both full datasets and daily batches from the GDELT endpoint, processing the data and storing it in Google Cloud Storage.
  
- **Cloud Storage & Cloud Functions:**
  - Cloud Storage acts as a central repository for processed data. Cloud Functions are triggered by new data uploads to initiate further processing in Compute Engine.

- **Compute Engine:**
  - Runs advanced data processing tasks, including KMeans clustering and LDA topic modeling. This is where the core analysis happens, utilizing TensorFlow Hubâ€™s Universal Sentence Encoder for embeddings.

- **BigQuery:**
  - Serves as the primary data warehouse, storing processed data and powering the SQL queries that feed into the dashboard.

- **Apache Superset:**
  - A powerful, open-source data exploration and visualization tool that connects directly to BigQuery, providing a dynamic, interactive dashboard interface for users.

- **Docker & Container Registry:**
  - Automates the deployment of data processing tasks using Docker containers. These containers are stored in Google Container Registry for easy management and scalability.

- **Gemini AI Integration:**
  - Utilizes Google Gemini AI for summarizing key insights from the news data, enhancing user comprehension and decision-making.

## Features

- **Daily Monitoring:** 
  - Continuously ingest and analyze global event data as it happens, ensuring up-to-date insights.
  
- **Advanced Analytics:**
  - Perform clustering, topic modeling, and other sophisticated analyses to uncover patterns and trends.

- **Interactive Visualizations:**
  - Utilize Apache Superset for rich, interactive dashboards that help you explore and understand the data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Google Cloud Platform Account:** Set up a GCP project to deploy the components.
- **Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed for containerizing the components.
- **Python 3.x:** Required for running the scripts locally if needed.
- **Apache Superset:** Install and configure Superset for dashboard visualization.
